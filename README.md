## Tech Stacks
#### Frontend 
- React (Typescript)
#### Backend
- Node (Typescript/Express)
- Socket.io
#### Database
- MySQL
#### Server
- TBD, but for now test on ngrok

## To Run the Program
- specify the .env file as .env-example
- run "npm install" in both frontend and backend folder
- DB should started
- run "npm start" in both frontend and backend folder

## API Endpoints + Socket communication
#### login (username=String, password=String)
- POST request
- return 200 if success else 400
#### create_account (username=String, password=String)
- POST request
- return 200 if success else 400
#### update_account (username=String, password=String)
- PUT OR PATCH request
- return 200 if success else 400
#### delete_account (username=String, password=String)
- DELETE request
- return 200 if success else 400

#### create_room (Socket io)
- io.on(connect)...
- create room in db
- socket.join()
- send msg
#### join_room
- io.on(connect)... 
- socket.join()
- send msg
- if room is full -> msg:”room is full!”

## DATABASE Table (MySQL)
### User (add delete and update to api endpoints)
| Column Name | Data Type | Constraints                |
|-------------|-----------|----------------------------|
| id         | INT       | PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT | 
| username    | VARCHAR(50) | NOT NULL     |
| password(hash?)    | VARCHAR(50) | NOT NULL     |
### Room
| Column Name | Data Type | Constraints                |
|-------------|-----------|----------------------------|
| id         | INT       | PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT | 
| username    | STRING OR INT | NOT NULL     |
| room_occupy| INT | CHECK (CONTAINS <= 2)|

## To Create DB
- now running locally (or test with ngrok)
- create .env to define details in db.ts
- and connect db and the backend
